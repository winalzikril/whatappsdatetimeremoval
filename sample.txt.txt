2/1/23, 7:01 PM - kamal: I appreciate you reaching out about this job opportunity. However, I have some concerns that this may not be a legitimate role. Jobs that promise easy money for simple tasks like clicking likes are often scams. I'd be happy to discuss more if you can provide company documentation, details on tasks, and pay structure. Otherwise I'll have to pass for now. Stay safe!

2/1/23, 7:05 PM - scammer: I understand your hesitation. Let me assure you this is a real opportunity with Shopee. The job is to help promote products which helps our sellers. The pay rate is per click or like, so the more you do, the more you earn. I can send you info on how to get registered in our system. Let me know if you would like to move forward.

2/1/23, 7:10 PM - kamal: Thank you for the additional details. I'm still unsure about the legitimacy of this role. Most companies do not pay individuals to simply like or promote products. And you have not provided any documentation that shows this job is officially through Shopee. I suggest focusing your efforts on more transparent and verifiable work opportunities. Wishing you the best.

2/1/23, 7:15 PM - scammer: I understand you are being cautious, which is smart. This is a new promotion program we are trying, which is why it may seem unfamiliar. Tell you what - why don't you try registering with us and if you are not satisfied you can withdraw with no penalties. I can send you the link to get started. Give it a chance and see for yourself the potential earnings. What do you think?

2/1/23, 7:20 PM - kamal: I appreciate the offer, but will have to decline. Too many red flags here - lack of official documentation, questionable pay structure, asking for registration without full transparency. My best advice is to avoid shady promotions that seem too good to be true. Take care.

2/1/23, 7:25 PM - scammer: I'm sorry you feel that way. This is a real opportunity but I understand your hesitancy. Let's keep in touch and I'll try to get you some more information to address your concerns. In the meantime, take care.

2/2/23, 9:30 AM - scammer: Hi kamal, I have an update for you. I asked my supervisor if we have any official documentation I can send you about the job program. He said we are still in the pilot stage so there are no public postings yet. But he can have someone from HR contact you directly to verify the details. Would a call from Shopee HR help alleviate your concerns? Let me know if you'd reconsider with that extra step.

2/2/23, 11:15 AM - kamal: Thank you for following up. A call from HR would be more reassuring. However, legitimate companies don't normally hire in this secretive manner for simple promotion jobs. I did some research and found no mention anywhere of Shopee having this type of program. I'm confident this is some kind of scam attempt. I won't waste any more time on it. But in the future, focus your energy on transparent, ethical work. Good luck.

2/2/23, 12:30 PM - scammer: I'm very sorry you feel misled in any way. That was not my intention. We are certainly a real company trying innovative things in e-commerce promotion. But I understand your position. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this opportunity and wish you the very best moving forward. Please don't hesitate to reach back out if you change your mind. Take care.

2/3/23, 3:45 PM - kamal: Hi there, I wanted to check back in about the job opportunity you mentioned. After doing some more research, I realized Shopee does have legitimate influencer and affiliate programs. I may have been too quick to dismiss your offer without understanding the full details. Would you still be open to discussing the role and providing more information on how it works? I want to make sure I give it proper consideration. Please let me know.

2/4/23, 9:15 AM - scammer: Hello kamal, thanks for circling back. I'm glad you reconsidered and did more research on our programs. We are still looking for promoters, so I'd be happy to discuss further details with you. The role is through our Shopee Affiliate program. You can earn commission by promoting certain products and directing traffic to them through your social media. You interested in learning more about how it works? I can have our Affiliate Manager send you info.

2/4/23, 11:30 AM - kamal: That makes more sense now, thank you for clarifying. Yes if you could have the Affiliate Manager provide official information on the program like registration steps, commission structure, payout process etc that would be great. I'd like to verify the specifics before fully committing. If it aligns with typical affiliate programs then I'm interested to apply. Please send over any links, documentation or contacts. Looking forward to learning more!

2/5/23, 10:45 AM - scammer: Sounds good, I'm connecting you directly with our Affiliate Manager Jason to discuss details and get you started. He can explain everything about our legit program. Here is his email jason@shopeeaffiliates.com. Let him know I referred you! Excited to have you on board. Take care.

2/5/23, 12:30 PM - kamal: Email sent

2/6/23, 9:15 AM - scammer: Jason reply?

2/6/23, 10:30 AM - kamal: No answer

2/7/23, 11:45 AM - scammer: I asked again

2/8/23, 1:15 PM - kamal: Still waiting

2/9/23, 3:30 PM - scammer: Try calling

2/10/23, 9:45 AM - kamal: Number invalid

2/10/23, 12:15 PM - scammer: That's strange

2/10/23, 1:30 PM - kamal: Very suspicious

2/10/23, 2:45 PM - scammer: Let me check

2/11/23, 10:30 AM - kamal: Waste time

2/11/23, 11:45 AM - scammer: My apologies

2/11/23, 12:15 PM - kamal: Clearly scam

2/11/23, 1:30 PM - scammer: I understand

2/11/23, 2:45 PM - kamal: Avoid future

2/11/23, 4:00 PM - scammer: Lesson learned

2/11/23, 5:15 PM - kamal: Goodbye friend

2/12/23, 8:30 AM - kamal: I never heard back from Jason after emailing the affiliate contact you provided. The number you gave me was invalid. This is making me think the job opportunity may not be legitimate after all. I am no longer interested if these are the games being played.

2/12/23, 10:15 AM - scammer: I profusely apologize for this experience. You are right that it seems suspicious now. I truly thought this was a real affiliate program opportunity when I contacted you. I will investigate where things went wrong here and why you never heard back. Thank you for your patience and for calling out these issues - it will help me improve. I wish you the very best.

2/13/23, 9:30 AM - kamal: I appreciate you owning up to the discrepancies here. While I can no longer trust this is a valid opportunity, I hope you learn from this experience. There are ethical ways to earn income without resorting to tricks and dishonest schemes. Wishing you well, but I must decline any further involvement. Take care.

2/14/23, 11:45 AM - scammer: You are completely right, and I regret wasting your time. I clearly have more learning and growing to do. Thank you again for your candor - it will stick with me as I move forward. I wish you great success in finding a position that is professional and legitimate in every way. Please accept my sincere apologies.

2/15/23, 1:30 PM - kamal: Apology accepted. I hope you are able to refocus your efforts in a more transparent and principled direction. Honest work is so important. Wishing you personal growth. Take care.

2/15/23, 3:45 PM - scammer: Wise words, my friend. I will reflect deeply. Thank you for your grace and understanding. This exchange has been invaluable. I wish you great success ahead - you deserve it. All the best, stay safe.

2/16/23, 5:00 PM - kamal: Hey, so about this job thing. I know you were excited about it but seems like it was too sketchy from the start. No real details, fake contacts, just red flags all around. I gave it a chance but gotta call it like I see it. Appreciate you understanding where I'm coming from. Ain't tryna waste any more time on shady stuff, ya feel me?
